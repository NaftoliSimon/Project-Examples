# About This Website

Welcome to my portfolio project that showcases my development skills and passion for creating engaging online experiences.

## Overview

This specific project is a full-stack blog website with my own API, designed to demonstrate my proficiency and innovation in web development.

## Viewing the Website
To view the front-end version of the website you can clone the github code to your machine.
Then, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Run to install necessary dependencies for this project.

### `npm start`

Running will automatically open the website in your browser (at port 3001) [http://localhost:3001]
Runs the app in the development mode.
The page will reload when you make changes.

___________________________________________________________________________
The only way to view the full features and capabilities of the website is from my personal computer which has the local database used with the site. You can view a front-end version of the website without database access, but some of the features won't be available (login/sign up features & adding or manipulating any website data).
